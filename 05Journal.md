# Learning Journal 301 Day 5 7/17/17

Throughtout this weekend I worked through my portfolio I had a lot of issues getting things to show up on the screen, I was so obbessed with making things workmy way that I didnt make too much progress but I'm proud that I do have a lot of code up at the moment. moving forward into today with JSON and AJAX seems to be very simililar to to what we learned in 201.
 I am feeling a bit behind but i dont think its nothing I cant catch up on I believe things are starting to make a little mor sense even though theres way more material im lost with I feel like the basic understandings are flowing.
