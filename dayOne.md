# Learning Journal 301 Day 1 7/10/17

Today started with a basic intro and overview of the class and what it'll look like over the next month. The schedule switch from mornings to afternoon is defientley a new obstacle im facing this time. All though it shoudln't really change much being we still have the mornings for lab time and 2 hours after lecture, also, I find it great that most of our work will include a partner, going about this in 201 helped a lot with me and finding errors within my own code through debugging others or seeing others debug mine. I'm very excited and looking forward to this intermediate course. I'm a little concerned with the fact that nobody but me raised there hand for plans to go into ios, feel a bit outcasted for that. It'd be nice to move forward with some classmates.
